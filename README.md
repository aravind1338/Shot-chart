This is a Flask (python) application that uses HTML and CSS to display an NBA players shot chart.

To run the application on your localhost:
  install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt
  run "python start.py" from your terminal

The application was up on pythonanywhere at (itsallrelative.pythonanywhere.com), but I took it down because they don't allow apps that scrape data from stats.nba.com
