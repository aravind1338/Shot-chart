This is a Flask (python) application that uses HTML and CSS to display an NBA players shot chart.

You also have the option of comparing the shot charts of two players, and choosing whether to look at a scatterplot or a heatmap representing all the shots that the player(s) took.

To run the application on your localhost:
  install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt
  run "python start.py" from your terminal

The application was up on pythonanywhere at (itsallrelative.pythonanywhere.com), but it wasn't functional because they don't allow apps that scrape data from stats.nba.com (yet)
